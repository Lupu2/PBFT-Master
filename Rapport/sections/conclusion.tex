\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:Con}
This chapter concludes the thesis by first listing the lessons we learned while working on this thesis. Then we list the potential future work which can be applied to the PBFT implementation.
Finally a conclusion is drawn for the work performed for this thesis.

\section{Future Work}
%1 mention fixing the broken public key system, and give examples(if you can think of any).
%2 potential things: 1. fix it so that the protocol workflow can handle any message being received in any order or 2. Implement a timeout process for the commit section so that the process can not become stuck in any scenario. Both are somewhat needed, but I have no idea how I can handle waiting for prepares before receiving the pre-prepare.
%3 Fix persistency. We believe we layed most of the foundation in regards to getting the system to be persistent. However, as mention in imp 2 issues are mainly present. 1. figure out a way to get rid of the original source referanse/access the original source reference so there is no longer duplicate requests. 2. Something is wrong with the synchronization. Not sure what is the cause, assume its the synchronization process is not fully finished before a new request is added. 
% 4 Generally make the application and client more interessting. Currently the application state is a simple list of commands written to the console. Make the application actually perform a set of commands, and redesign the client to accomodate for this change.
