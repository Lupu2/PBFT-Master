\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:Imp}
Implementation talks about the actual algorithm implementation that is run in protocol execution, includes process of checkpoints and view-changes. Should have figures to simplify explanation. Go over briefly the different phases, show some pseudocode. keeps to take note of, maybe include a model to show the persistency layers present. The importance of using the cleipnir scheduler and CTask, where you have used them etc.
